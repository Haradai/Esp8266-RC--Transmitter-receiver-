# Esp8266-RC--Transmitter-receiver
A low cost solution for communication in RC devices. 
"Use the esp8266 as the FC and receiver in a quadcopter, and controll it from a webpage in your phone"
"Same with anything else, planes, cars, submarines..."

:The actual code is for a miniquadcopter, but it is really easy to change the variables for your own purpose.(Just delete, add or rename and you'll be ready to go!)

:This is still in development, please help! :)
