# Esp8266-RC--Transmitter-receiver
A low cost solution for communication in RC devices. 
"Use the esp8266 as the FC and receiver in a quadcopter, and controll it from a webpage in your phone"
"Same with anything else"

:The actual code is for a miniquadcopter, but it is really easy to change the variables for your own purpose.(Just delete, add or rename and you'll be ready to go!)

:It works but has some bugs that need to be solved.

The board I am working on is the Wemos D1 mini V2 but it may also work on other boards. Please share it in the comments section if it worked for you in other boards!
