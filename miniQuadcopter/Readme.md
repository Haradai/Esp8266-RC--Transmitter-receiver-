These are the files for the mini quadcopter.

NOTES:
-The raw file, means that it is the C code without the webpage in it.(To load it in the ESP8266 use the complete file)


Making the ESP8266 function as an Access point and a webserver wasn't a good idea, the webpage struggles to reload and doesn't function properly. This is why I decided to use an external access point.(Branch Alpha-0.2)
